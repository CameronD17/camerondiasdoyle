## 2019-Present FanDuel

I currently work for FanDuel Group as a senior software engineer, working primarily with Java microservices in the User Account sector.

### Account & Wallet (2019-Present)
                              
Throughout my time at FanDuel, I have worked in the Account space, building the KYC capabilities of the company from a single jurisdiction of requirements, to a system handling over 20 states' varying requirements, while still allowing the end user to maintain a single account.

This has involved integrating with several vendors in the KYC space, leading the technical implementations performed by various third-party contractor teams, architecting new services and libraries within FanDuel, and mentoring multiple junior software engineers to promotion paths.

### GAN Migration

One example of a key project that I worked on in my time at FanDuel was a migration project to import existing users from a third-party system into our in-house Account (at the time representing around 80% of our user base). I was a leading engineer within the project, and it was a huge success, leading to a patent being issued for the algorithms I designed that were used in our migration service (US Patent [US-20230004556-A1](https://ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/20230004556)).
                        
## 2017-2019 Avaloq

I joined Avaloq as a software engineer in the spring of 2017, working primarily as a Java developer in one of the web banking teams.
               
### AFP Web Banking

#### Java Developer (2017-2019)

Throughout my time at Avaloq, I worked primarily in the middle server tier as a Java developer, with some occassional work in JavaScript/AngularJS/Angular on the front end, and PL/SQL in the back end. During my final year, I also worked with developing a Spring microservice and integrating it successfully with the main server tier.

I was the senior developer, and SME, for several key areas within our project, responsible for implementing new innovations and managing the maintenance of these areas. I developed strong relationships with key customers, implemented new functionality to meet client needs, and steered the components through various upgrade cycles and improvements.

#### Scrum Master (2019)

I was the primary scrum master within my team, following a variation of the SAFe Scaled Agile methodology. My role involved mentoring my team, handling and prioritising customer issues and requests, and managing the delivery and scheduling of our array of supported software versions.

## 2014-2017 CGI

I rejoined CGI as a graduate in the summer of 2014, and began working in various roles in the Government sector, including Java development, performance, and team management.

### Scottish Government - AFRC

#### Java Developer (2016-2017)

After spending over a year learning and working as a performance analyst and team lead, I changed roles to work deeper in the development cycle of the system. I'm currently working as a Java developer in a team of six, using JBoss BRMS and Fuse.

I work using a test-driven development process, using JUnit for unit tests and EclEmma for code coverage to provide assurances for my code quality. Other software and technologies used include Oracle SQL, SoapUI, Maven, Subversion, and Jenkins.

#### Performance Team Lead (2015-2016)

Having worked as a performance analyst for several months, I was promoted to team lead for non-functional testing within the AFRC project, training three new members in performance testing and analysis, and managing the performance test schedule. I advised senior client management on performance metrics and directions, and worked closely with database and deployment managers to ensure a continued smooth transition to live.

#### Performance Analyst (2014-2015)

After my initial few months at the Scottish Government with systems integration and working my way up to team lead, I joined the non-functional team working as a performance analyst. Here, I learned about load-testing and performance metrics, and rebuilt the project's performance testing suite in JMeter from the ground up. The role required me to liaise closely with senior client management, helping me develop important negotiation and client communication skills.

## 2010-2014 Newcastle University

In the summer of 2014, I graduated from the [University of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne](https://www.ncl.ac.uk) with an upper second-class honours (2:1) degree in Computer Science.

### Modules

At Newcastle, I was awarded first-class marks for my work in Mobile Development, Programming for Games, Graphics for Games, Games Development, Server-side Web Development, and Cryptography. I also studied Advanced Programming, Database Technologies, Computer Networks, Modelling and Computation, Algorithm Design and Analysis, Internet Technology, and Software Project Management.


My final dissertation project was focused on designing and developing a travel-planning website and mobile application. This was developed using PHP and Android, as well as SQL and server technologies, and was awarded upper second-class marks.

### 2012-2013 Logica

During my degree studies, I spent a year in industry working for the IT consulting firm [Logica](https://www.cgi.com/en). At Logica, I worked as a business and test analyst within the Financial Services sector, developing business scenarios for the client, and designing development criteria for our team of off-shore developers.
