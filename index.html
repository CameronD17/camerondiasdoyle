		<h1>Who I Am</h1>

		<p>I currently live in {{ site.data.settings.author.location }} with my wife, JÃºlia, our dog <a href="https://www.instagram.com/charlie.border.collie/">Charlie</a>, and our two cats, Tommy and Tegan.</p>
		<p>I spend most of my free time running (sometimes with my wife, sometimes with Charlie, and sometimes with both), and I'm also currently learning to speak Portuguese.</p>
		<p>Alongside this, I also have a keen interest in behavioural economics, third-wave coffee culture, and (when I can find the time) being a terrible facsimile of a Dungeon Master.</p>
