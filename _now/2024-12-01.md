## Home

JÃºlia and I are married! That was probably self-evident from the fact I've been migrating (slowly) over to the new domain now that I have a new surname.

Things have been going well, albeit not really feeling too different. I keep using the wrong name for both myself and for J, I'm assuming that will self-correct in time, like when you write the previous year in all of your dates for the first part of January until it sinks in.

## Running

I'm starting to get myself ready for a long year of running; Chicago marathon in October is the Big Goal. I'm not setting a target yet though; I've also signed up to run the Edinburgh marathon in May, so that performance will dictate my A/B/C goals for Chicago.

Charlie has also fully retired from Canicross now. We still occasionally run together, off-leash and at his pace, but he's run his last race now (at the annual Cani-sports Edinburgh race at Whitekirk Hill). It was very emotional for me to accept that he is getting old; he's still just my wee boy in my eyes.
